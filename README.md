# NTL-Image-Classification-and-Reverse-Image-Search

This a project I created as task for Next Tech Lab

In this model I used cifar-10 dataset to train the model with the help of tensorflow 


  This model not only predicts the image class but also predict similar images which is a feature google use for it's Search by Image
